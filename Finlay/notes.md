# Intro #
My Year 12
Hi everyone
This presntation is online at , so feel free to follow along or if you wan

# Sorry #
For taking up your busy mentor sesssions
I understand you are probably sick of these sessions, where someone comes in and tells you how you should be studying and give you a speel about goals, so im instead going to share with you all the tips I wasn't given at those seesions that I found helpful. 
Some of those tips are not.

# I have three main tips #

# Steal #
There a ton of resources that are posted online both by other students and teachers.
Make then most of them.

 dont actually steal

## The good ones I have found ##
### English Language ###
### Physics ###
	- Melbourne High
### IT ###

# Facebook #
-  	Question have you at any point considered deactiviating your facebook for year 12?
I didnt and I wouldn't recommend deleting it

# Practice Exams and SACs #

- Do as many as possible
- Get a copy of them now
	- if you cant get a copy of them all just yet try and get a list of them 
		(or at least a rough number of how many you will have access to)
- It's never to early to start doing them
	- start before you finish the subjects content in class
	- that way you already have a feel for what questions are important when you go over it in class 
- Log your results
	- (Surprisingly) incredibly motivational

# Organise #
I have left this one to last as I think it is the most important
 -  Use Google Calendar
 	- Quick an Easy to set up 
 	- Works on every device
 	- Means you always have your timetable on you.
 	- Google Calendar makes it really easy to rearrange your events - which is great
 ## Tips #
  - put **everything** in it. 
  	- school classes timetable
  		Initially I was just using it for my school classes timetable, but it was so convineitnt I eneded up using it for everything
   	- study times
   	- SAC Dates
   	- Exam Dates
   	- any other event in your life
   	- connect it with facebook
   		Facebook offers two different calendar streams
   		One for all the events you are invited to on facebook
   		and one for your friends birthdays, ( which is great cos it means you can eaily see who's birthday is in the next few days and wish them a happy birthday if you bump into them - it makes you look like a truely great friend)
  - Use the notifications features it has:
  	- particuarly for your study events
  		That way even your phone is reminding you to study, so you have no excuse 
  - add it to your phones homescreen (Andoid)

# Other random things I did that helped #
- Put notes in your shower
- If it takes less then 5 mins, do it now
- Set up your desk for that night's study before you leave for school
- Focus (almost) entriely on the things that count (SACs and Exams)
- Use a template for all Word Documents

# Resources #
- Original exam timetable ( not really that useful :P )
- Exam Results Log (year 11, 12)
- word document template


- My Physics Cheatsheet
- My Media File English Language

# Questions #
 - Ask Now
 - Ask Later
 	- Facebook
 	- Email
 	- In person
 		- I tutor in Greenways every Thursday after school - come say hi

# Good luck #
